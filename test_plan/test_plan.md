# Test Plan for Extension Scheduler

## 1. Installation and Setup:

- Verify that the extension can be installed from the Chrome Web Store without any issues.
- Check that the extension icon is displayed correctly in the browser toolbar after installation.
- Ensure that the default options and settings are set correctly upon installation.

## 2. Popup Functionality:

- Open the extension popup by clicking on the extension icon in the toolbar.
- Verify that the popup displays the relevant information, such as start time, end time, active days, and selected
  extensions.
- Test the functionality of changing the start time, end time, and active days and ensure that the changes are saved
  correctly.

## 3. Options Page:

- Open the options page by right-clicking on the extension icon and selecting "Options."
- Check that all the options and settings are presented clearly and are easily configurable.
- Verify that changes made in the options page are reflected correctly in the extension popup and background
  functionality.

## 4. Extension Scheduling:

- Test the functionality of adding extensions to the list of selected extensions for scheduling.
- Ensure that selected extensions can be added and removed from the scheduling list without errors.
- Verify that the extension state (enabled/disabled) can be toggled based on the active time range and active days.

## 5. Time Conversion and Validation:

- Test the time conversion functions to ensure that times are correctly converted between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
- Validate inputs to prevent invalid or nonsensical time configurations.

## 6. Extension Icon:

- Test the extension icon changes based on the scheduling status and active time range.
- Verify that the icon displays the correct state (scheduled on/off) for each selected extension on the chrome:
  //extensions/ page.

## 7. Error Handling:

- Intentionally provide incorrect inputs (e.g., invalid time format) and ensure that appropriate error messages are
  displayed to the user.
- Verify that the extension handles errors gracefully and does not crash or affect other functionalities.

## 8. Performance and Efficiency:

- Test the extension's performance and efficiency by adding a large number of extensions to the scheduling list.
- Monitor CPU and memory usage to ensure that the extension does not cause significant performance degradation.

## 9. Compatibility:

- Test the extension on different versions of Google Chrome to ensure compatibility.
- Verify that the extension functions correctly on both Windows and macOS platforms.

## 10. User Interface and User Experience:

- Conduct usability testing to evaluate the user interface and user experience of the extension.
- Ensure that the extension is intuitive and easy to use for users with different levels of technical expertise.

## 11. Regression Testing:

- After making changes or updates to the extension, conduct regression testing to ensure that existing functionalities
  continue to work as expected.

## 12. Security Testing:

- Assess the extension for potential security vulnerabilities.
- Ensure that the extension does not compromise user data or browser security.

Note: This test plan provides a general outline for testing the Extension Scheduler. The actual test cases and scope may
vary based on the specific functionalities and requirements of the extension. It is essential to thoroughly test the
extension to ensure its reliability, performance, and user satisfaction.
